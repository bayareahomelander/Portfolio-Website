# Portfolio-Website

This is a fully-functional, interactive personal portfolio website. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript; contains a multitude of features such as embedded external links, animation (jQuery), responsive media (layouts automatically adjust as the window resizes). Below are screenshots of some of the features.

**2022-11-07: Project is still under construction. More features to be added.**

*1. This is the full layout of the website's homepage - a brief greeting, homepage wallpaper, a back-to-top icon at the lower right-hand corner, four icons that have links embedded, and a navigation bar at the top with three quick links. The 'ML Enthusiast' is one of three strings that are supposed to show up, and it has a different font since it's designed to change automatically with a typing animation.*

*2. This would be the website layout if one were to view it on a smartphone - the website is resized to be small-screen friendly. The quick links at the upper right-hand corner turn into a menu bar for a better experience.*

*3. This will show up if the menu bar icon is clicked when viewed on a smaller screen. The menu bar turns into a close icon.*

*4. Here is a quick self-introduction, and a photo on the left-hand side. Once clicked, the download button would redirect to a new tab with the resume available for download in .pdf version. The button would blend into the website's background when hovered.*

*5. This section of the website contains some of my past personal projects, they are displayed as separate cards while each has a short introduction regarding the main idea of project. The text automatically scales up while the background blends in when hovered (See the card in the middle for reference).*
